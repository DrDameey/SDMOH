## Introduction
The impact of social determinants on mental health within the medical community in Nigeria has not been widely reported. The aim of this study is to investigate three social determinants of health (Economic stability, Social and community context & Negative life events) and determine their influence on mental health, thereby causing symptoms of depression amongst doctors and nurses working in some parts of Nigeria.
